🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)
This is a simple Python mini project that I built while revising my Python basics.  
The goal of this project is to improve logical thinking using loops and conditions.
## 🌱 About the Project
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.  
The user keeps guessing the number, and the program gives hints:
- 📈 Too High – if the guess is greater than the number  
- 📉 Too Low – if the guess is smaller than the number  
The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and then it shows the total number of attempts.
## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me understand:
- How `while` loops work
- How `if-elif-else` conditions control program flow
- How to take user input and convert data types
- How to use the `random` module in Python
- How and when to use `break`
